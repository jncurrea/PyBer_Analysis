# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of the project
The aim of this project was to analyze a dataset regarding ride sharing data. This data covered from city type, to date, time and fare for each ride.. The main tool used to develop this project was python 3 through Jupyter Notebooks. Now, let's dig into it...

## Results: 
The analysis must start with a break up of the percent of rides per city type. Notice how urban cities have a greater percentage of rides; this may be due to the number of people in the location or availability of drivers as well.

Now, the data answers this same question. Notice, in the following graph, how there are significantly more drivers in urban areas than in suburban or rural areas. This can be one of the main reasons for having more rides in urban areas.
