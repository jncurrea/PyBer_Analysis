# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of the project
The aim of this project was to analyze a dataset regarding ride sharing data. This data covered from city type, to date, time and fare for each ride.. The main tool used to develop this project was python 3 through Jupyter Notebooks. Now, let's dig into it...

## Results: 
The analysis must start with a break up of the percent of rides per city type. Notice how urban cities have a greater percentage of rides; this may be due to the number of people in the location or availability of drivers as well.
